//PROTOTYPE CHAINING
    //[[Prototype]]

    //data types have built in methods to call

const snacks = {
    fruit: 'banana',
    tastyTreats: ['carrot cake', 'M&Ms']
};

//when you call toUpperCase on fruit, an object wrapper is created for fruit so that it can be translated into uppercase
    //this goes for all data types
console.log(snacks.fruit.toUpperCase());
    //toUpperCase is just an example of a hidden property that all objects and data types have

console.log(snacks.tastyTreats.join(' '));
    //The array.join() method is an inbuilt function in JavaScript which is used to join the elements of an array into a string.The elements of the string will be separated by a specified separator and its default value is comma(, ).
    // Syntax:
    // array.join(separator)

//We are exploring the hidden property known as the prototype property

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(snacks.fruit));
    //Returns the prototype of an object.
    //@param o â€” The object that references the prototype.
        //returns string because fruit is intitialized as a string

//How to see this in chrome dev tools
console.dir(snacks.tastyTreats);
    //shows items in array, the length(2), and __proto__: Array (0)
        //__proto__ can be a mouthfull to say(underscore underscore proto underscore underscore)
        //instead the javascript community has coined the term "Dunder" for the underscores
        //so "Dunder proto" instead

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(snacks.tastyTreats));
